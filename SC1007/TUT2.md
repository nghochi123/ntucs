# Tutorial 2: Analysis of Algorithms and Stack and Queue

1. The function subset() below takes two linked lists of integers and determines whether the first is a subset of the second. Give the worst-case running time of subset as a function of the
   lengths of the two lists. When will this worst case happen?

When the first linked list is not a subset of the second linked list. Then, the $\Theta$ notation will be $\Theta(LM)$.

2. Find the number of printf used in the following functions. Write down its time complexity in Î˜ notation in terms of N.

   Q2a. $\Theta^2$.

   Q2b. $\Theta^2$.

3.
