    "# Runge Kutta methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last few exercises we explored Euler's method of finding numerical solutions to the Initial Value Problem:\n",
    " \n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y),\\quad y(x_0)=y_0.$$\n",
    " \n",
    "The method, giving us approximate function values $y_1^*,y_2^*,y_3^*,\\ldots$, corresponding to a given set of points $x_1,x_2,x_3\\ldots$ was summarized in the recurrent formula:\n",
    " \n",
    "$$y_0^*=y_0,\\quad y_k^*=y_{k-1}^*+f(x_{k-1},y_{k-1}^*)(x_{k}-x_{k-1}),\\quad k=1,2,\\ldots.$$\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "While being easy to understand (we use the derivative provided by $f$ and the estimated function value $y_{k-1}^*$ at one point to guess the value $y_k^*$ at the next point), Euler's method is however not very precise and often you will need very small step sizes $x_k-x_{k-1}$ to get reasonable accuracy.\n",
    " \n",
    "Fortunately, there are better methods available. One commonly used family of methods are the Runge-Kutta methods. The basic idea behind these methods is the same as for Euler's method, but instead of only using the derivative value provided by $f$ at $(x_{k-1},y_{k-1}^*)$, these methods use weighted averages of values of $f$ *at a few different points near $(x_{k-1},y_{k-1}^*)$*. Exactly how and why this works, is outside the scope of this course, but feel free to look it up if you are interested (Googling \"Runge-Kutta\" should give you some info).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a function `rk4` that applies a \"fourth order\" Runge-Kutta method to the initial value problem above. You can use it exactly like you use the `euler` function from your previous exercise. You don't have to understand how it works, but as mentioned above - feel free to look it up."

    "2. Do the same again, but using `rk4` (provided above) instead of `euler`.\n",
